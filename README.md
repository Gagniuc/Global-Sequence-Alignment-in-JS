# Global Sequence Alignment in JS

This JavaScript implementation makes a <b>global alignment</b> between two strings, namely s0='TGAATTCAGTTA' and s1='TGGATCGA'. In fact, this simple implementation makes an alignment between any two strings. All symbols from UTF-8 are accepted by this algorithm. For an implementation of local alignment please see see [this repository](https://github.com/Gagniuc/Local-sequence-alignment-in-JS).
